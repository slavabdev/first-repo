            <p class="text"> And I’m starting to regret agreeing to meet a friend from school I haven’t seen or
                heard from in 15 years. Every thing will be alright though. We used to do
                everything together. Then we left school and they dropped off the face of the
                Earth. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago when they emailed me an invitation to attend
                their house out in the sticks. Why didn’t I just ignore it. </p>
